# Rant Room
The Rant Room is your one-stop survival kit for whenever you are feeling down!

During difficult times, it is easy to feel isolated and overwhelmed, but not have anyone to talk to. In the Rant Room, vent out your worries to your heart's content then release them to the stars!

Feel free to explore the other rooms as well! Visit the Board to remind yourself that you are not alone in your worries, or explore the Portal for mental health support options or simply to find something fun to do!

Notice: This project was developed for a hackathon, and may not be stable. Some pages on the [Heroku site]{https://rant-room.herokuapp.com/} do not work, as the final version of this site was hosted locally.
